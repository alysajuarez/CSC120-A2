What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

this assignment was definitely frustrating at times because object oriented programming can sometimes feel messy when writing it, even though it ultimately makes code less messy. what worked for me was making some of the methods like updating operating system and price. it also really helped to reference other code and examples from class to get a feel for how to implement methods, and also just spending time thinking about the code and what i needed it to do. working in oo_resale_shop.py was more difficult because we had to bring over the computer class, so i had trouble getting methods there to work. sitting in front of my laptop and staring was also not working for me so i'm glad i started the assignment early and was able to step away when i needed to.
on that note, advice i would give to someone taking this course would be to start homework assignments early so you enough time to work on them, instead of trying to get everything done the day before. it seriously helps so much to be able to work on code over time instead of all at once. every new day that i'd open up vscode, things genuinely did start to make more sense! being able to step away and come back helps you not get overwhelmed and too frustrated, and also allows you to seek help (which is also advice i would give!) without harsh time constraints.
